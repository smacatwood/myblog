This is my first attempt at a post.

It serves as a basis of formatting future posts. 

I am extremely apprhensive writing this. Creating this blog. Attaching my name to something so vulnerable. No teacher or mentor has ever given me the indication I should or can write. This comes from a belief only in the voice of my mind. So I will try. And I will fail. But I will get better.
